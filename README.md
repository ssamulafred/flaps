Title: Why Banning the Use of Cell Phones While Driving Should Be Mandatory Nationwide

I. Introduction:
The general purpose of this speech is to persuade the audience that banning the use of cell phones while driving should be mandatory nationwide. The central idea is that a national ban would save lives, reduce accidents, and create consistent laws that protect all road users. This speech will address how cell phone use while driving increases crash risks, how a nationwide ban would improve public safety, and why consistent laws are necessary to effectively reduce distracted driving.

II. Topic Sentence 1:
Using a cell phone while driving significantly increases the risk of accidents.
A. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (2023), distracted driving caused 3,522 deaths in the United States in 2021, with cell phone use being one of the leading causes (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2023).
B. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2022) reports that drivers who text are 23 times more likely to be involved in a crash compared to those who are not distracted (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022).

III. Topic Sentence 2:
A nationwide ban would improve public safety and save lives.
A. A study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (2022) found that states with strict hands-free laws experienced a significant reduction in fatal crash rates compared to states with weaker regulations (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, 2022).
B. The Governors Highway Safety Association (2023) reports that hands-free laws have reduced cellphone use while driving by up to 16% in states where they are actively enforced (Governors Highway Safety Association, 2023).

IV. Topic Sentence 3:
Consistent national laws would reduce confusion and improve enforcement.
A. The National Conference of State Legislatures (2023) states that current distracted driving laws vary widely across states, creating confusion for drivers who travel between states (National Conference of State Legislatures, 2023).
B. According to AAA (2022), 94% of drivers recognize distracted driving as a serious issue, yet many continue the behavior due to unclear or inconsistent legal consequences (AAA, 2022).

V. Conclusion
In conclusion, using cell phones while driving greatly increases the risk of accidents, a nationwide ban would improve public safety and save lives, and consistent laws would reduce confusion and improve enforcement. Banning the use of cell phones while driving should be mandatory nationwide to protect drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. I urge you to support stricter distracted driving laws, commit to using no-phone or hands-free policies while driving, and encourage others to put their phones down to help make our roads safer for everyone.
